# EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH. IF THIS IS STILL HERE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
might have new bugs, might bring old bugs back bc I fixed them in the main branch and forgot to port it. don't bother complaining about them until this readme is gone.
## Current status: worked last time I ran it
### Key features:
- moves most of the big functions into separate files
- generates base dsdicts that actually work most of the time(currently advanced export only)
### Goals:
- get liteconvert(in the files but unused) to work
- implement Ghin's segmenter instead
- target Mix_LN branch due to single environment required
- un-Conda everything(much harder than it sounds)
